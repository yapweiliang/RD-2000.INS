Contents:
- [Roland RD-2000] patches
- [Roland RD-2000 Rhythm] drum with note names
- [Roland RD-EXP] patches (02 to 05 only)

To do:
- [ ] add V-PIANO EXPANSION patches
- [x] discover if can reference EXP patches? yes: see http://forums.rolandclan.com/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=55167
- [x] decided that the PERCUSSION patches need not be defined as *drum* (as 1089 Reverse Cymb is not a one-hit tone)
- [x] to correct some minor spelling mistakes (consistency of whitespace)
- [x] to add RD-EXP patches (or at least the ones that I use)

If there are any corrections that you would like me to make, please raise it as an Issue

Additional notes:
- David Dor√© has added the other EXP patches here: https://community.cantabilesoftware.com/t/cakewalk-ins-file-exchange/6665
