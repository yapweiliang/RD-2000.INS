Roland RD-2000 Cakewalk Instrument Definition File

Based on information extracted from the Roland manuals.  

Seems to work (tested with Cakewalk By Bandlab, previously known as Sonar Platinum)

Contains
- [Roland RD-2000] patches
- [Roland RD-2000 Rhythm] drum with note names

To do:
- [x] discover if can reference EXP patches? yes: see http://forums.rolandclan.com/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=55167
- [x] decided that the PERCUSSION patches need not be defined as *drum* (as 1089 Reverse Cymb is not a one-hit tone)
- [ ] to correct some minor spelling mistakes (consistency of whitespace)
- [ ] to add RD-EXP patches (or at least the ones that I use)
