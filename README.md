# RD-2000.INS
Roland RD-2000 Cakewalk Instrument Definition File

Based on information extracted from the Roland manuals.  

Seems to work (tested with Cakewalk By Bandlab, previously known as Sonar Platinum)

Contains
- [Roland RD-2000] patches
- [Roland RD-2000 Rhythm] drum with note names

To do:
- [ ] discover if can reference EXP patches?
- [x] decided that the PERCUSSION patches need not be defined as *drum* (as 1089 Reverse Cymb is not a one-hit tone)
