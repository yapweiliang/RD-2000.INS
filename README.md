# RD-2000.INS
Roland RD-2000 Cakewalk Instrument Definition File

Initial attempt, based on information extracted from the Roland manuals

**Warning: not yet tested...**

Contains
- [Roland RD-2000] patches
- [Roland RD-2000 Rhythm] drum with note names

To do:
- [ ] discover if can reference EXP patches?
- [x] decided that the PERCUSSION patches need not be defined as *drum* (as 1089 Reverse Cymb is not a one-hit tone)
